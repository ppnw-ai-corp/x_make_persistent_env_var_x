# x_make_persistent_env_var_x — Production Ledger

I catalogue every substantive adjustment to this environment vault here. Entries obey [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so compliance teams can tie configuration evidence to specific releases.

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- PySide6 experiment scrapped under explicit protest; the Tkinter dialog is back in service and the legacy module now only exists as a disgust-drenched stub for compatibility.
- Rebuilt the Tkinter dialog plumbing so `_TokenDialog` runs under guarded imports, prefers native widgets when available, and falls back to console prompts without breaking type checks or Ruff.
- Hardened the CLI dispatcher: new `--launch-gui` flag, explicit JSON exit codes, and automatic injection of the `command` field for schema compliance.
- Expanded test coverage with a CLI dispatch harness that stubs the Tk dialog flow to keep GUI verification in CI.
- Default token suite now mandates `SLACK_TOKEN` so Slack automation never runs without a verified API credential.
- Added optional `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` support to the default token catalogue so bot-side Slack workflows can be staged without blocking existing runs.
- Default token suite now captures the required `COPILOT_REQUESTS_PAT` so Copilot CLI provisioning stays turnkey alongside PyPI, GitHub, and Slack credentials.
